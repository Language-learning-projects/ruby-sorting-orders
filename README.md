# Ruby sorting orders

This repository contains code of a learning project called: "Ruby sorting orders".

It's purpose is to implement different algorithms to sort a list of words by length, alphabetical order and sum of ASCII values.

## Idea

A script that uses sorting algorithms to sort a list of words by their length, alphabetical order, and the sum of the ASCII values of their characters. The script should use a bubble sort algorithm to sort the words by their length, a quick sort algorithm to sort the words by their alphabetical order, and a merge sort algorithm to sort the words by the sum of the ASCII values of their characters. The script should also use recursion techniques to implement the quick sort and merge sort algorithms. Additionally, the script should include a function that calculates the time complexity of each sorting algorithm and prints it out.

## Learning

- Ruby
- Bubble sort
- Quick sort
- Merge sort
- Time complexity calculation.

## Requirements

- A user must be able to sort a list of words by the length of words.
- A user must be able to sort a list of words by the alphabetical order of letters.
- A user must be able to sort a list of words by the sum of ASCII values.
- A user must be able to sort a list of words by any combination of the other sorting algorithms.
